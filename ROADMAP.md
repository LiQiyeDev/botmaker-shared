# ROADMAP

A running history of features and refactors for `botmaker-shared`, for future Claude Code sessions.
**Append here whenever you add a feature or refactor** (required — see `CLAUDE.md` › Planning).

Format: newest first. Each dated entry has a **Done** list and, when relevant, **Deferred / next**
(intentionally left for later, with enough context to pick up cold).

## 2026-07-06 — Extracted into a standalone shared module

**Done**
- **Extracted the cross-platform native window plumbing** (`capture.*` — `NativeController`,
  `NativeControllerFactory`, `GenericWindow`, and the `windows/` + `linux/` JNA backends) out of the SDK
  and Studio into this dedicated module so both consume one copy instead of duplicating it.
- **Coordinate:** published as `com.github.LiQiyeDev:botmaker-shared` (JitPack); the umbrella reactor
  builds it first. The SDK and Studio depend on it via a `${botmaker.shared.version}` property
  (`0.0.0-SNAPSHOT` in the reactor, a real tag once released).
- **Depends only on JNA** — no JavaFX, no OpenCV. Full-desktop capture backends stay in the consumers.

**Deferred / next**
- **macOS backend** — `NativeControllerFactory.get()` currently throws `UnsupportedOperationException`
  on macOS; a Cocoa/CoreGraphics `NativeController` would light up the Mac path for both consumers.
- **Wayland-native per-window capture** — `captureWindow` returns `null` under native Wayland today;
  a portal/PipeWire backend here would remove the consumers' full-desktop fallback for that case.
