/**
 * <b>Can this target actually be confined to a private display?</b> — asked <em>before</em> bring-up, so a
 * launch either isolates or says precisely why it can't. Single-sourced here because the SDK's bot runtime, the
 * nested session itself and Studio's launch surfaces all need the same answer in the same words.
 *
 * <p><b>Why an up-front probe, rather than launching and seeing.</b> Every way this fails used to look
 * identical from the outside: the private display sat empty for the whole window budget (up to two minutes for
 * a store launcher), the half-booted child was then reaped — which is how an Electron launcher ends up dying
 * with a {@code SIGTRAP} coredump — and the user got one guess as the explanation. The three causes are
 * distinguishable up front and want three different actions, so they are named:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Blocker#NO_CHILD_COMMAND} — the kind has no command form at all ({@code epic:} hands its launch
 *       to a URL opener, an emulator app runs over ADB). Nothing to hand a {@code DISPLAY} to.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Blocker#HOST_LAUNCHER_OPEN} — the launcher's UI is already up on {@code :0} and is
 *       single-instance, so our child forwards to it and the game maps on the real desktop.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Blocker#PORTAL_WOULD_ESCAPE} — the only installed form is the Flatpak one, and there is no
 *       {@code dbus-daemon} to give the session its own Flatpak portal. This is the one that motivated the
 *       whole phase: the host's {@code flatpak-portal} is a D-Bus-activated service holding {@code DISPLAY=:0},
 *       and it spawns the game's container from <em>its</em> environment, so the game escapes to the real
 *       desktop no matter what the launcher was handed. Measured live: {@code steam-runtime-launch-client}
 *       still on {@code :3}, then {@code pv-adverb} and {@code wineserver} on {@code :0}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Blocker#NOT_INSTALLED} — no rung of the ladder names a program that exists here.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>It never guesses in the safe direction.</b> Every probe behind it is best-effort and total (an
 * unreadable {@code PATH} or process table answers "no evidence"), and the verdict is only a refusal when
 * something was positively observed — refusing a launch that would have worked is worse than attempting one
 * that fails, because the attempt still ends in a message.
