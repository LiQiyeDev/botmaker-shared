/**
 * JNA bindings for libXcomposite, used to capture a window's <em>off-screen</em> pixmap.
 *
 * <p>When a compositing manager is running, each top-level window's full contents are kept in an
 * off-screen backing pixmap. Reading pixels straight off the on-screen window drawable (plain
 * {@code XGetImage} on the window) returns <em>black</em> for any region occluded by a window in
 * front, because there is no on-screen backing store for the covered pixels. Naming and reading the
 * off-screen pixmap instead yields the whole window, occluded or not.
 *
 * <p>The library is loaded lazily and defensively via {@link #instance()} — it returns {@code null}
 * when libXcomposite is unavailable, so callers fall back to the on-window capture path.
