/**
 * Whether a gesture has to hand the cursor back — the one question every click path has to answer, in the one
 * place that answers it.
 *
 * <p>On the user's own desktop, borrowing the cursor and putting it back is the whole reason synthesized input is
 * tolerable: {@link NativeController#clickRestoringCursor} exists for exactly that. Inside a private session
 * ({@link Capability#BACKGROUND_CLICK}) the pointer is the bot's alone, there is nothing to be polite to, and the
 * warp away is <b>actively harmful</b> — a UI that samples the pointer position per frame rather than reading the
 * event's coordinate sees it somewhere else by the next frame and renders a <em>hover highlight where a click
 * should have registered</em>. That is not a hypothesis: it is what a live bot did on an adopted gamescope
 * session, finding its template, clicking it, and getting nothing but the hover.
 *
 * <p>This type exists because that rule was written down in {@link NativeController}'s javadoc and then
 * implemented in only one of the two consumers — Studio's pilot honoured it, the SDK's {@code Mouse} restored the
 * cursor unconditionally, and every template click in a session threw its own button press away. A policy both
 * modules need is exactly what shared is for, so neither can drift from it again.
