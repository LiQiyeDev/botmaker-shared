/**
 * What the launched application actually said — the reading every "why didn't it start?" question needs, and
 * the one this stack used to throw away.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> {@link NestedSession} spawned the app with {@code Redirect.DISCARD} on
 * <em>both</em> streams, so a launch that failed inside a session left no trace but its exit. The user-visible
 * cost was a Steam title that wouldn't start and a bug report built entirely out of an unrelated coredump: the
 * only artefact left behind was pressure-vessel's {@code bwrap --unshare-all … --seccomp <fd> /usr/bin/true}
 * capability probe dying on {@code SIGSYS} — which is that probe working as designed, fires on every Steam
 * launch, and was measured on a launch that succeeded. Two hours of reading a red herring, because the real
 * message was discarded microseconds after it was written.
 *
 * <p><b>A file first, the log second.</b> Everything goes to a file that outlives the session (Proton and the
 * store launchers are voluminous, and the interesting line is rarely the last one), while only a bounded
 * prefix is echoed into {@link Diag}. Unbounded echoing would be its own defect: a Proton cold start buries
 * every {@code [Session]} line under winetricks output, and a diagnostic nobody can find is not far from one
 * that was never printed. After {@link #MAX_ECHOED_LINES} the echo stops with a pointer to the file.
 *
 * <p>stdout and stderr deliberately land in the <em>same</em> file: their interleaving is itself evidence
 * (which message preceded which), and separating them would make a reader reconstruct the order by hand.
