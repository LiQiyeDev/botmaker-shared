/**
 * A {@link DesktopSession} over a private nested display the bot owns — the piece that makes background input
 * <em>flawless</em>. Because the game runs in its own Xephyr {@code :N}, that display's global pointer and
 * keyboard focus are the bot's alone: the same device-level XTest injection that would hijack the real cursor
 * on {@code :0} is, on {@code :N}, both accepted by the game <em>and</em> invisible to the user driving their
 * real desktop. That is why — unlike {@link HostSession} — a nested session honestly advertises
 * {@link Capability#BACKGROUND_CLICK}, {@link Capability#ISOLATED_FOCUS} and {@link Capability#MULTI_SESSION}.
 *
 * <p>A nested session <b>launches</b> its target (it cannot attach across servers — X11 has no window
 * migration), stopping any instance already running on {@code :0} first. Bring one up with {@link #start},
 * then {@link #launch(LaunchSpec)} the game into it. Everything it spawns — the X server, an optional window
 * manager, the game — lives in one {@link SessionReaper} group, so {@link #close()} reaps the whole tree.
 *
 * <p>Two display backends sit behind one {@link SessionDisplay} seam, chosen by {@link Options}: {@link
 * NestedDisplay} (Xephyr, 2D — no {@link Capability#HARDWARE_GL}/{@link Capability#VULKAN}) and {@link
 * GamescopeDisplay} (gamescope, hardware 3D — adds both). The supervisor here is identical for both. Launch
 * covers every kind with a <em>child-launchable</em> command (via {@link
 * com.botmaker.shared.launch.LaunchCommands}): {@code exe:}/{@code cli:} directly, and the store launchers
 * that expose a CLI form ({@code heroic:}/{@code steam:}/{@code faugus:}) run as our own child so they inherit
 * {@code DISPLAY=:N} instead of the daemon-routed protocol URL, which a launcher already on {@code :0} would
 * swallow. Kinds with no CLI form — {@code epic:} (URL-only) and {@code emu-app:} (ADB) — cannot map onto a
 * private display and are refused (a loud failure, never a silent {@code :0} fallback).
