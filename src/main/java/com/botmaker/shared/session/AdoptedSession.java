/**
 * A {@link DesktopSession} over a private display <b>someone else brought up</b> — the session a bot joins
 * instead of starting its own.
 *
 * <p><b>The workflow this exists for.</b> Bring the game up once in Studio ("▶ Launch now" / Remote Pilot
 * background mode), watch it, tune the bot, then run the bot: without this, the bot's own
 * {@code SessionBootstrap} would try to bring up a *second* private display and launch the game into it — and the
 * launcher, being single-instance, would hand that launch to the copy already running in the first session. The
 * game would end up somewhere nobody was watching. So the bot adopts the live session instead: same display, same
 * window, no second launch.
 *
 * <p><b>It owns nothing.</b> The display server, the window manager, the private bus and the game all belong to
 * whoever started them; {@link #close()} drops this session's own two X connections and stops there. That is the
 * whole difference from {@link NestedSession}, and it is why this is a separate class rather than a flag: a reap
 * from the wrong side would tear down the session its owner is still using.
 *
 * <p><b>What it can't do.</b> No {@link Capability#WINDOW_LAUNCH}: launching is the owner's job, and the target is
 * expected to be up already ({@link #launch} logs and does nothing rather than starting a rival copy). Everything
 * else a nested session offers, it offers — the display genuinely is private, so background clicks and isolated
 * focus hold.
