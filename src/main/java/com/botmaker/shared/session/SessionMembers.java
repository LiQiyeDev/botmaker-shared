/**
 * <b>Which processes belong to a nested session — when the cgroup can no longer say.</b>
 *
 * <p>{@link SessionReaper} groups everything it spawns in one systemd slice, which is what makes "{@code kill -9}
 * the JVM ⇒ zero orphans" true. For a Flatpak target that guarantee is <em>false</em>, and the reason is not
 * ours to fix: {@code flatpak run} moves the app into its own transient {@code app-flatpak-<id>-<n>.scope} under
 * {@code app.slice}, and it does so over {@code /run/user/<uid>/systemd/private} — the systemd user manager's
 * private socket, not D-Bus, so the session's private bus cannot intercept it and there is no flag to disable
 * it. The evidence is in the crash itself:
 *
 * <pre>
 * PID: 312266 (heroic)   Signal: 5 (TRAP)
 * Command Line: /app/bin/heroic/heroic --no-gui --no-sandbox heroic://launch/43d4…   &lt;- our launch argv
 * Control Group: /user.slice/…/app.slice/app-flatpak-com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl-3053722396.scope
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Our argv, someone else's cgroup. So {@code systemctl --user stop <our slice>} never signalled the launcher
 * or the game at all: it killed gamescope, Xwayland {@code :N} vanished under a live Chromium, and Chromium's
 * X11 IO-error path aborted. That {@code SIGTRAP} coredump on every teardown was not a cosmetic wart — it was
 * the reap path being blind to the processes it most needs to reap, and the <em>only</em> reason nothing was
 * left running afterwards. A launcher that survives losing its X connection would simply have leaked.
 *
 * <p><b>So membership is asked of the environment instead.</b> Every process in the chain carries the session's
 * {@code DISPLAY=:N} — or its unique private bus address — and neither survives being handed to a portal by
 * accident: they are there because we put them there. A live run shows the whole escaped chain that way
 * ({@code pv-adverb}, {@code wineserver}, {@code umu.exe}, {@code Firestone.exe}), cgroup notwithstanding.
 *
 * <p>Best-effort and total: an unreadable or vanished {@code /proc} entry answers "not a member", never throws.
 * Linux-only by construction ({@code /proc}); on any other OS the scan simply finds nothing.

	 *   <li><b>The session's own infrastructure</b> — {@code dbus-daemon} and the window manager are launched
	 *       <em>with</em> {@code DISPLAY=:N}, so they match the environment test and would be killed alongside
	 *       the game, which is precisely the ordering this exists to prevent. They are excluded by cgroup rather

	/**
	 * Ask the session's payload to exit, then insist — <b>oldest process first</b>.
	 *
	 * <p>The order is the whole fix, and it took three live runs to find the right one. Signalling all 35
	 * processes of a launcher's tree at once left the {@code SIGTRAP} coredump exactly where it was; so did
	 * walking the process tree parents-first. The reason is that under Flatpak the tree lies: {@code zypak}
	 * reparents Chromium's renderer and zygote helpers onto {@code flatpak-portal}, so they are <em>not</em>
	 * children of the launcher — a parents-first walk ranks them ahead of it and kills them underneath a live
	 * browser process, which Chromium treats as unrecoverable and aborts on.
	 *
	 * <p>Start time cannot be lied about that way: a process always starts after whatever spawned it, whoever it
	 * is later reparented to. So the oldest member — the launcher itself — is asked to exit first and given room
	 * to take its own tree down, which is what a clean shutdown looks like.
	 *
	 * <p>If it refuses that invitation, it is {@link ProcessHandle#destroyForcibly() killed} before anything else
	 * is touched. A {@code SIGKILL} cannot be handled, so it cannot abort, so it cannot dump — a launcher that
	 * ignores {@code SIGTERM} costs a hard kill, never a coredump.
