/**
 * A private D-Bus session bus the nested session owns — and, through it, its <b>own Flatpak portal</b>. This is
 * what makes isolation hold for a launcher we do not control.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a private display is not enough.</b> Handing a launcher {@code DISPLAY=:N} only confines processes
 * that are its descendants. A Flatpak launcher's game usually is not: Heroic runs it through umu, which
 * re-enters the host with {@code steam-runtime-launch-client --bus-name=org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak}, and
 * {@code flatpak-portal} is a <em>D-Bus-activated service of the host session</em> whose own environment holds
 * {@code DISPLAY=:0}. It spawns the container from <em>its</em> environment, so the game lands on the real
 * desktop no matter what the launcher was given — {@code --pass-env-matching=*} does not save it. Measured on
 * a live run, the flip is visible process by process: {@code steam-runtime-launch-client} still on {@code :3},
 * then {@code pv-adverb}, {@code proton} and {@code wineserver} all on {@code :0}.
 *
 * <p><b>What this fixes, and how.</b> A bus started here inherits the session's environment, so the portal
 * <em>it</em> activates does too — and the container that portal spawns therefore lands back on {@code :N}. The
 * same live chain, re-run with this bus in place, showed {@code pv-adverb} and {@code wineserver} on the private
 * display. The mechanism is structural rather than cooperative: it does not ask the launcher to behave.
 *
 * <p><b>The crux is the generated service file.</b> The stock
 * {@code /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak.service} carries a {@code SystemdService=}
 * line, which defers activation to the user-global {@code flatpak-portal.service} — i.e. to the very portal that
 * already holds {@code DISPLAY=:0}. We therefore point the bus at a service directory of our own containing the
 * same {@code Name=}/{@code Exec=} and <b>no</b> {@code SystemdService=}, so the bus spawns the portal itself.
 * Without that omission this whole class is a no-op.
 *
 * <p><b>A private bus is genuinely private.</b> Host session services (notifications, the secret store, a
 * system tray) are not reachable from it. That is mostly a feature — it is also what stops a launcher's
 * single-instance check from finding the copy already running on your desktop and forwarding our launch to it,
 * which was the original "close Heroic and try again" failure. A launcher that needs the host keyring to log in
 * would notice; one that keeps its own credentials (Heroic does) does not. Verified live: Heroic enumerated its
 * full library and launched normally on a bare private bus. There is deliberately no {@code xdg-dbus-proxy}
 * bridge — {@code dbus-daemon} cannot forward unknown names upstream, so a hybrid "our portal, the host's
 * everything else" bus is not expressible; the choice is one bus or the other.
 *
 * <p>Best-effort by contract: if {@code dbus-daemon} is missing or never prints an address, {@link #start}
 * returns {@code null} and the session runs display-isolated only, exactly as it did before this existed.
