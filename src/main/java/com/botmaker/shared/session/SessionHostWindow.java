/**
 * The nested display server's own window <em>on the host desktop</em> — the black rectangle a user watches while
 * a store launcher takes its two minutes to boot.
 *
 * <p>Xephyr maps its output window on {@code :0} the instant it starts and nothing is drawn into it until a client
 * maps something on {@code :N} — which for a store launcher is up to two minutes of black rectangle on the user's
 * real desktop. This type minimizes that window and restores it the moment the session has something in it. It
 * deliberately does <em>not</em> hide the launcher: the reveal fires on the <em>first</em> window to appear on
 * {@code :N}, the store launcher's own UI included, because seeing the bot's session is half the point of running
 * it visibly.
 *
 * <p><b>gamescope needs none of this, measured.</b> While its Xwayland has no clients, gamescope's host window is
 * not mapped at all — no {@code WM_STATE}, absent from {@code _NET_CLIENT_LIST} — and it appears the instant a
 * client maps something. So there is no empty black window to hide, and by the time this class can even find the
 * window there is already content in it; {@link #anythingMappedOn} is what keeps us from minimizing that. The
 * short black flash a gamescope user does see is the gap between its window being mapped and its first rendered
 * frame, which is not something we can iconify away.
 *
 * <p><b>Iconify, not unmap.</b> {@code XIconifyWindow} sends the ICCCM {@code WM_CHANGE_STATE} message the host
 * WM acts on, which is reversible with a plain {@code XMapWindow}. A bare {@code XUnmapWindow} would instead take
 * the window out of the WM's management and leave restoring it to us.
 *
 * <p><b>Best-effort by construction.</b> {@link #find} returns {@code null} whenever the host window can't be
 * identified — no host {@code DISPLAY} (a Wayland host with no Xwayland), a host WM that publishes no
 * {@code _NET_CLIENT_LIST}, a server that advertises neither {@code _NET_WM_PID} nor a distinctive class. That
 * case is today's behaviour: a visible window during bring-up, no regression. Every operation opens its own
 * short-lived connection to the host display rather than holding one for the session's lifetime, because there
 * are only two of them (hide once, reveal once) and a session should not carry an X connection it almost never
 * uses.
