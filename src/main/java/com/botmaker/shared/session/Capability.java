/**
 * What a {@link DesktopSession} can actually do, so a bot can <b>fail fast</b> instead of silently no-op'ing.
 *
 * <p>The whole reason this enum exists: the same "click the game" call has completely different guarantees on a
 * host session (moves the real cursor, forces the window forward) versus a nested one (a private pointer on
 * {@code :N}, truly in the background). Rather than let a bot discover that at runtime by watching its clicks do
 * nothing useful, a session advertises its capabilities up front and the caller checks
 * {@link DesktopSession#has(Capability)} before relying on one.

	 * Clicks land on the target while it stays in the background <em>and</em> games accept them as hardware.
	 * A host session deliberately does <b>not</b> advertise this: its only background-safe path is

	 * and foregrounding the window. Only a nested {@code :N} session, whose global pointer is the bot's alone,
	 * can offer it.
