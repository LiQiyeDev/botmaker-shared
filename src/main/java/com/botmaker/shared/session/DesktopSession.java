/**
 * One display a bot drives — the seam that lets the <em>same</em> bot code target either the user's real
 * desktop or a private nested {@code :N} server without knowing which. It <b>wraps</b> the existing
 * {@link NativeController} + input-backend stack rather than replacing it: a {@link HostSession} wraps the
 * default {@code :0} controller (today's behaviour, unchanged); a future {@code NestedSession} (Phase 2) wraps
 * a controller bound to {@code :N} and adds the {@link Capability#BACKGROUND_CLICK}/{@link Capability#ISOLATED_FOCUS}
 * guarantees the host session can't make.
 *
 * <p>A session either {@link #attach(GenericWindow) attaches} to an existing window or {@link #launch launches}
 * a fresh target into itself; either way the attached window is where {@link #capture()} and the
 * window-targeted input paths point. Closing a session releases its resources (and, for a nested one, reaps
 * the whole process tree).
