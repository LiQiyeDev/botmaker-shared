/**
 * Which window a session drives, and the one rule for keeping that answer true: <b>re-resolve when the window we
 * attached to has gone</b>.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this can't be a plain field read.</b> A launcher chain does not map the game's window first. A live
 * Heroic run mapped a {@code ProtonFixes} setup dialog, which the attach (correctly, at the time) took; the dialog
 * then closed, the game's own window appeared beside it, and the session was left holding a destroyed window —
 * {@code capture()} returned {@code null} for the rest of the run and every keystroke went to a window that no
 * longer existed, while the game sat there perfectly capturable. The session reported {@code HEALTHY} throughout,
 * because it <em>was</em>: only the attachment had rotted.
 *
 * <p>The recovery is one cheap round trip ({@code XGetWindowAttributes} on the current window) and, when it fails,
 * the "most recently mapped top-level" rule the initial attach uses. Deliberately narrow: it only ever
 * <em>replaces</em> a window that has died, so a session that never attached stays unattached (a failed launch
 * must not look like a successful one), and a live attachment is never second-guessed.
 *
 * <p>Extracted from {@link NestedSession} when {@link AdoptedSession} arrived: a bot that adopts a session someone
 * else brought up watches the same launcher chain swap windows under it, and this bug must not exist in two
 * places.
