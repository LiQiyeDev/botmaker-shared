/**
 * A private display a nested session owns — the X server the bot's {@link NestedSession} drives so its global
 * pointer and focus are the bot's alone. Two implementations sit behind this seam: {@link NestedDisplay}
 * (Xephyr, the cheap 2D host) and {@link GamescopeDisplay} (gamescope, the hardware-3D host with an embedded
 * Xwayland). {@link NestedSession} depends only on this narrow surface, so the same supervisor — launch the
 * game, find its window, inject XTest, reap the tree — drives both backends unchanged.
 *
 * <p>The one thing that genuinely differs between the two, beyond how the server is spawned, is 3D capability:
 * {@link #hardwareAccelerated()} is what makes a session advertise {@link Capability#HARDWARE_GL}/
 * {@link Capability#VULKAN}. Everything else a session needs is the display name (to bind a controller and set
 * children's {@code DISPLAY}), its size, and whether the server is still alive.
